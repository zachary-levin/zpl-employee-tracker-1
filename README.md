# zpl-employee-tracker-1 
  ## Description
  
  - What was my motivation? I wanted to create an application utilizing MySQL2, Inquirer, Node.js that tracks a company's departments, roles, and employees for organization and business purposes.
  - Why did I build this project? I built this project to test my MySQL skills in creating a real-world, practical application.
  - What problem does it solve? It solves the issue of having to rebuild an entire MySQL table every time a user wants to update one row or column of data.
  - What did I learn? I learned how to utilize MySQL in conjunction with Inquirer and Node.js to create an application that users can use comfortably in a terminal. 
  - What makes my project stand out? My project contains comments that make it more readable and easy to follow for other developers.

  ## Challenges
  - One of the challenges I struggled during the development of this project was running queries from the `index.js` file and rendering it based on the user's choice for the initial prompt.
